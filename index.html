                            I graduated from the University of British Columbia in May 2020 with a Bachelors in Commerce from the 
                            Sauder school of business. Since then, I've spent time learning Google Analytics, Google Ads, and 
                            taking Harvard CS50 to learn C++, Python, Javascript, SQL as well as some HTML and CSS. That's about 
                            it for accomplishments of note.<br>
                            I've become quite passionate and curious about solving problems in our evolving world. Specifically 
                            problems associated with data analysis, data privacy, and digital marketing. This has led me to 
                            explore Digital Marketing as a career path, as well as pursue (upcoming) blockchain/software 
                            projects in my spare time. 
                            Personally, I love photography, writing, and mixing drinks. Naturally, where I grew up (Vancouver, 
                            BC), there were many outdoor activities to choose from. So I enjoy good hikes up the local mountains 
                            when I get the chance.<br>
                            I've included some examples of the aforementioned below. Feel free to explore.

                                to develop skills in computer science that would be valuable to have if I was going to pursue
                                a career in the tech industry. I loved the course, and would recommend it to anyone wanting
                                to dive into coding as a beginner.

                                I knew that it would be a valuable skill to have for Digital Marketing roles, but I honestly was also
                                just curious to see how fast I could learn the interface and use it to solve problems.

                                This certificate actually accounts for two seperate certificates. They are so closely related that I 
                                decided it would be better to include them both under the same heading. They are the Google Search Ads 
                                Certification and the Google Display Ads Certification. I completed both consecutively in January 2021 
                                after realizing the importance of skillfully navigating Google Ads to optimize the performance of 
                                Google Analytics.

                                During my fourth year at UBC, I was lucky enough to get into a course called New Venture Design,
                                or NVD for short. This was an 8-month course that paired business students (me) with engineering
                                students to come together in groups of 6, find a problem in our worlds, and solve it with the creation of a product.
                                It sounds simple, but we had to go through a long process of finding an idea that had a viable and
                                potentially profitable market, conduct market research with real stakeholders, and then create a 
                                prototype of our product. Our team chose to tackle the lack of environmental information in marijuana
                                growing operations (which are legal in Canada). This led to Tangie Systems, an IoT (internet of things) 
                                device that measured multiple variables in a grow op environment. The idea is that this device is 
                                modular and would be bought in bundles, placed strategically in the environment, and then transmit 
                                detailed data and metrics to growers so that they can optimize their yield.<br>
                                By the time the course finished, we had finished building a prototype and had med with potential 
                                board members who were interested in seeing the idea through. Sadly, with many of our group 
                                graduating at this time, the project has remained just that, a project. If you're ever interested 
                                in finding out more about my role (lead generation, financials, market research & analytics), or 
                                in the project itself, shoot me an email.

                        free to check it out.

                        I put almost all my writing, whether it's updates on my life, thoughts on books, project updates, 
                        and more on my blog. I would put an RSS feed directly on this page, but I don't know the intricacies 
                        of XML and am not familiar with Javascript yet to make that a thing. Plus, all the websites that do it 
                        for you cost money and I'm not a fan of that. So for now, please use the button below.

                                What can I say, I'm grateful that I've been around (not drinking) wine for a considerable 
                                portion of my life. In fact, while in university, I took two courses on the subject. After 
                                which, I have amassed knowledge on wine regions, tasting characteristics, and growing. 
                                The curse of the knowledge being that I look like a snob when ordering food. That is, until I 
                                mispronounce Chianti (every single time). In all realness, I understand the industry well, 
                                and I'm fascinated at how I might apply my technical knowledge to it. Don't 
                                get me wrong, when buying for myself, I'm going for price over quality (mostly because my bank account 
                                won't allow otherwise). Wine is something worth sharing, not a reasion to be a snob.

                                much, with cocktail recipies. I'm quite a fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCioZY1p0bZ4Xt-yodw8_cBQ">

                                        when I made it for the first time, I had to make 3 more immediately. It uses cold brew concentrate (you can buy this 
                                        or make it yourself) instead of espresso and oh my does it just taste amazing. Here's how I make it: 
                                    </div>
                                    <div>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>1 oz. Cold Brew</li>
                                            <li>1 oz. Kahlúa</li>
                                            <li>1 splash Grand Marnier/Cointreau</li>
                                            <li>1 piece of shaved lemon skin</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        To a shaker filled with ice, add the cold brew, kahlua, grand marnier, and then twist the lemon (to let out some 
                                        of the aromatics) into the shaker but don't throw it in. Shake well and strain into glass with ice. Take the lemon 
                                        shaving and brush it around the rim of the glass (you can throw it in the drink after this, that's what I do). Then, 
                                        for added fanfare, should you choose, garnish with a few coffee beans. Then enjoy as you get the buzz of a vodka-redbull 
                                        without the sugar overload, and with all the flavour.

                                        This one is one of my favourites to order when going out for drinks with friends. It's sour and sweet and it has whiskey. 
                                        I firmly believe in the power of a whiskey cocktail. Either way, here's my basic recipie that plays off the inspiration: 
                                    </div>
                                    <div>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>2.5 oz. Whiskey [choice of which is personal preference, choose something you like]</li>
                                            <li>1 oz. Lemon Juice [squeeze this yourself if possible]</li>
                                            <li>1 oz. Simple Syrup</li>
                                            <li>1 Egg White</li>
                                            <li>Angostura Bitters</li>
                                            <li>0.5 cups Merlot Wine</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Similar to the last, add it all but the bitters to a shaker, shake, then strain over ice. Drop a few angostura bitters 
                                        over the top of that lovely foam and add a choice of garnish (I usually add the lemon), and you're set.<br>
                                        If you're making 
                                        the New York version, you'll be floating a red wine on the drink. Try to use Burbon as your whiskey, I recommend a Merlot 
                                        or fruit forward red wine as your float. For this recipie, ignore the egg white and angostura bitters. Shake the whiskey, 
                                        lemon juice, and simple syrup and then strain into a glass with ice. Then carefully pour the red wine down the side of the 
                                        glass onto the sour. It should remain somewhat seperated. It's a lovely twist on the classic sour and provides something 
                                        less sour than the original.
