Sauder school of business. Since then, I've spent time learning Google Analytics, Google Ads, and \n                            taking Harvard CS50 to learn C++, Python, Javascript, SQL as well as some HTML and CSS. That's about \n                            it for accomplishments of note.<br>\n                            I've become quite passionate and curious about solving problems in our evolving world. Specifically \n                            problems associated with data analysis, data privacy, and digital marketing. This has led me to \n                            explore Digital Marketing as a career path, as well as pursue (upcoming) blockchain/software \n                            projects in my spare time. \n                            Personally, I love photography, writing, and mixing drinks. Naturally, where I grew up (Vancouver, \n                            BC), there were many outdoor activities to choose from. So I enjoy good hikes up the local mountains \n                            when I get the chance.<br>\n                            I've included some examples of the aforementioned below.

I loved the course, and would recommend it to anyone wanting\n                                to dive into coding as a beginner. \n                            </div>\n                            <button id=\"cs50button\" href=\"https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/d579ec64-cb70-4a8b-8753-901c15f8e878\" value=\"see certificate\"></button>\n                        </div>\n                        <div id=\"googanacert\" class=\"col\">\n                            <div>\n                                <a href=\"https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/path/2938-google-analytics-individual-qualification\"><img id=\"googanalogo\" src=\"/5dd77e3f7338d1814fc36d989c1423d5.png\"></a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div> \n                                I completed my Google Analytics Individual Qualification in January 2021. I took this course because\n                                I knew that it would be a valuable skill to have for Digital Marketing roles, but I honestly was also\n                                just curious to see how fast I could learn the interface and use it to solve problems. \n                            </div>\n                            <button id=\"googanabutton\" href=\"https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/award/68011280\" value=\"see certificate\"></button>\n                        </div>\n                        <div id=\"googadscert\" class=\"col\">\n                            <div>\n                                <a href=\"https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list?category_ids=2844-google-ads-certifications\"><img id=\"googadslogo\" src=\"/84ad142b9d187b12b1f17777756ad2cf.png\"></a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div> \n                                This certificate actually accounts for two seperate certificates.

They are the Google Search Ads \n                                Certification and the Google Display Ads Certification. I completed both consecutively in January 2021 \n                                after realizing the importance of skillfully navigating Google Ads to optimize the performance of \n                                Google Analytics. \n                            </div>\n                            <button id=\"googsearchbutton\" href=\"https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/award/68408804\" value=\"see search certificate\"></button>\n                            <button id=\"googdisplaybutton\" href=\"https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/award/68449978\" value=\"see display certificate\"></button>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"Projects\">\n                        projects\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"Projects\" class=\"row\">\n                        <div class=\"col\">\n                            <div>\n                                <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eqMWIomZzCIsC53HI1faoPtLrNAoGbVoVF9cSXDYKW4/edit?usp=sharing\">\n                                <img id=\"tangielogo\" src=\"/bcdaa81c3cbcf25aea4cab3788209056.png\"></a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div>\n                                During my fourth year at UBC, I was lucky enough to get into a course called New Venture Design,\n                                or NVD for short. This was an 8-month course that paired business students (me) with engineering\n                                students to come together in groups of 6, find a problem in our worlds, and solve it with the creation of a product.\n                                It sounds simple, but we had to go through a long process of finding an idea that had a viable and\n                                potentially profitable market, conduct market research with real stakeholders, and then create a \n                                prototype of our product. Our team chose to tackle the lack of environmental information in marijuana\n                                growing operations (which are legal in Canada). This led to Tangie Systems, an IoT (internet of things) \n                                device that measured multiple variables in a grow op environment. The idea is that this device is \n                                modular and would be bought in bundles, placed strategically in the environment, and then transmit \n                                detailed data and metrics to growers so that they can optimize their yield.<br>\n                                By the time the course finished, we had finished building a prototype and had med with potential \n                                board members who were interested in seeing the idea through. Sadly, with many of our group \n                                graduating at this time, the project has remained just that, a project.

I'm not a professional by any means \n                        but I have shot portraits for profile photos, buildings for project managers, etc. However, \n                        I much prefer to take photos of things that interest me. I rarely update my instagram, but feel \n                        free to check it out. \n                    </div>\n                    <button id=\"instabutton\" value=\"instagram\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/camnelius/\"></button>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"Writing\">\n                    <div>\n                        blog\n                    </div>\n                    <div>\n                        I put almost all my writing, whether it's updates on my life, thoughts on books, project updates, \n                        and more on my blog. I would put an RSS feed directly on this page, but I don't know the intricacies \n                        of XML and am not familiar with Javascript yet to make that a thing. Plus, all the websites that do it \n                        for you cost money and I'm not a fan of that. So for now, please use the button below.\n                    </div>\n                    <button id=\"blogbutton\" value=\"blog\" href=\"https://camhendo.wordpress.com/\"></button>\n                </section>\n                <section id=\"Drinks\">\n                    <div>\n                        alcohol\n                    </div>\n                    <div>\n                        enjoy responsibly and enjoy because-its-been-a-long-week aren't mutually exclusive \n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                        <div class=\"col\">\n                            <div>\n                                wine\n                            </div>\n                            <div>\n                                What can I say, I'm grateful that I've been around (not drinking) wine for a considerable \n                                portion of my life. In fact, while in university, I took two courses on the subject. After \n                                which, I have amassed knowledge on wine regions, tasting characteristics, and growing. \n                                The curse of the knowledge being that I look like a snob when ordering food. That is, until I \n                                mispronounce Chianti (every single time). In all realness, I understand the industry well, \n                                and I'm fascinated at how I might apply my technical knowledge to it. Don't \n                                get me wrong, when buying for myself, I'm going for price over quality (mostly because my bank account \n                                won't allow otherwise). Wine is something worth sharing, not a reasion to be a snob.                             \n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"col\">\n                            <div> \n                                cocktails\n                            </div>\n                            <div>\n                                We have the pandemic to thank for this one. Being stuck at home meant I started to experiment, maybe too \n                                much, with cocktail recipies. I'm quite a fan of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCioZY1p0bZ4Xt-yodw8_cBQ\">\n                                How To Drink's Channel</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9ArHUJZadlhwt3Jt0tqgA\">The Educated Barfly's Channel</a> \n                                on YouTube.

It uses cold brew concentrate (you can buy this \n                                        or make it yourself) instead of espresso and oh my does it just taste amazing. Here's how I make it: \n                                    </div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <ul>\n                                            <li>1 oz.

Shake well and strain into glass with ice. Take the lemon \n                                        shaving and brush it around the rim of the glass (you can throw it in the drink after this, that's what I do). Then, \n                                        for added fanfare, should you choose, garnish with a few coffee beans. Then enjoy as you get the buzz of a vodka-redbull \n                                        without the sugar overload, and with all the flavour. \n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col\">\n                                    <div> \n                                        whiskey sour [option to make New York sour]\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFKZPzfngcU\">[inspiration one,</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewtc9sutgWI\">inspiration two]</a> | \n                                        This one is one of my favourites to order when going out for drinks with friends. It's sour and sweet and it has whiskey. \n                                        I firmly believe in the power of a whiskey cocktail. Either way, here's my basic recipie that plays off the inspiration: \n                                    </div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <ul>\n                                            <li>2.5 oz. Whiskey [choice of which is personal preference, choose something you like]</li>\n                                            <li>1 oz. Lemon Juice [squeeze this yourself if possible]</li>\n                                            <li>1 oz. Simple Syrup</li>\n                                            <li>1 Egg White</li>\n                                            <li>Angostura Bitters</li>\n                                            <li>0.5 cups Merlot Wine</li>\n                                        </ul>\n                                        Similar to the last, add it all but the bitters to a shaker, shake, then strain over ice. Drop a few angostura bitters \n                                        over the top of that lovely foam and add a choice of garnish (I usually add the lemon), and you're set.<br>\n                                        If you're making \n                                        the New York version, you'll be floating a red wine on the drink. Try to use Burbon as your whiskey, I recommend a Merlot \n                                        or fruit forward red wine as your float. For this recipie, ignore the egg white and angostura bitters. Shake the whiskey, \n                                        lemon juice, and simple syrup and then strain into a glass with ice. Then carefully pour the red wine down the side of the \n                                        glass onto the sour. It should remain somewhat seperated. It's a lovely twist on the classic sour and provides something \n                                        less sour than the original. \n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n            </section>\n            <section id=\"Footer\">\n\n            </section>\n        </div>\n        \n        <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/locomotive-scroll@3.5.4/dist/locomotive-scroll.min.js\"></script>\n        \n    </body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"050e2c200e25598ad27ff35e303f73dd","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
